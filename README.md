# mini-projects
This repository contains a collection of mini-projects that I have worked on. The projects are written in Python and are independent on their own. The projects are organized into folders.

## Projects
### 1. The Dijkstra Algorithm as a simple pygame
In this minigame you can draw walls and a target. With any press on the keyboard the algorithm will find the shortest path to the target.
### 2. The simplest Text-To-Speech with Google
This is a simple TTS application that uses the Google TTS API. You can type in a message and the application will play the message.
### 3. Read all WI-FI passwords on Windows
This is a simple application that reads all saved Wi-Fi passwords on Windows.
### 4. A simple ChatGPT console application. 
Just type in a message and the model will generate a response. Before you need to insert your `API key` in a `api.key` file.
### 5. A Base64 encoder
This is a simple application that encodes a file to Base64 and saves it to a file.
### 6. Keras Discord Notifier
This is a simple application that notifies you on Discord after every epoch of your training. You need to change the discord webhook url in the `keras_model.py` file.
### 7. A simple gradio UI
This is a simple application that uses gradio to create a UI for a model.
### 8. A simple autokeras model
This is a simple application that uses autokeras to create a model.
### 9. A YouTube downloader UI with exe build
This is a simple application that uses pytube to download YouTube videos. The application is built into an exe file using pyinstaller.
### 10. An example on how a Perceptron works
This is a simple application that shows how a perceptron works.
### 11. Keras first steps
Shows how to create a simple models using Keras.
### 12. LiDAR data visualization
This is a simple application that visualizes different LiDAR Setups in comparison to each other. Used for Formula Student Teams.
### 13. PDF Splitter
This is a simple application that splits a PDF file into multiple PDF files. Just defines categories and colors and the application will split the PDF file.
### 14. Reinforced Learning with OpenAI Gym
This is a simple application that uses OpenAI Gym to train and test a model to play the CartPole game.
