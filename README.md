# mini-projects
This repository contains a collection of mini-projects that I have worked on. The projects are written in Python and are independent on their own. The projects are organized into folders.

## Projects
### 1. The Dijkstra Algorithm as a simple pygame
In this minigame you can draw walls and a target. With any press on the keyboard the algorithm will find the shortest path to the target.
### 2. The simplest Text-To-Speech with Google
This is a simple TTS application that uses the Google TTS API. You can type in a message and the application will play the message.
### 3. Read all WI-FI passwords on Windows
This is a simple application that reads all saved Wi-Fi passwords on Windows.
### 4. A simple ChatGPT console application. 
Just type in a message and the model will generate a response. Before you need to insert your `API key` in a `api.key` file.
