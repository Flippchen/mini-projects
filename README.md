# mini-projects
This repository contains a collection of mini-projects that I have worked on. The projects are written in Python and are independent on their own. The projects are organized into folders.

## Projects
### 1. The Dijkstra Algorithm as a simple pygame
### 2. The simplest Text-To-Speech with Google
